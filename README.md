## 🔍 Phishing Indicators

| # | Indicator | Explanation |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Urgent Financial Notice** | Claims a large payment ($495.42) was made, invoking urgency. |
| 2 | **Suspicious Link** | The URL was removed for security, but such links often redirect to phishing sites. |
| 3 | **Spoofed Sender Name** | "Peoples Bank" is a generic name and could be easily spoofed. |
| 4 | **No Personalization** | Email doesn’t mention user name or account info — a red flag. |
| 5 | **Old or Irrelevant Dates** | Date shown is 2005, which doesn’t make sense in a 2025 context. |
| 6 | **No Reply Mechanism** | Email explicitly says it doesn't accept replies — common in phishing. |
